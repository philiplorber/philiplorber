# Philip Lorber Portfolios

## Welcome to my portfolio

1. Data Analysis - Tableau üîç

Loaded and transformed data from a CSV file, created calculated columns related to values per square meter, and performed a comparative analysis of bathrooms and bedrooms. Developed visualizations including bar charts, scatter plots, Treemaps, and symbol maps, incorporating dynamic filters. Built an interactive dashboard with full integration between all charts.

2. Data Analysis - Python üîç

Used Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to load and clean real estate data. Created calculated columns for metrics like price per square meter and unbuilt surface area. Developed bar charts and scatter plots to visualize property values and surface area, using logarithmic scales for better clarity. Additionally, a boxplot was created to analyze the distribution of property values across different areas.
